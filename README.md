**** AUTOMATED NOTES MAKER ****

"Efficient note taking everywhere"
         
         
The Automated Notes Maker primaririly works on the theme of eliminating Manual note taking and saving the time
of an individual. This design mainly includes Natural Language Processing to achieve the features such as Speech to Text,
Summarisation,Keyword Extraction,Named Entity Recognition,Language Traslation and finally Text to speech.
          Along with natural language processing we have also used Machine Learning models for the coversion of speech 
into the text with in less amount of time.
          This project is helpful for students very much in order to take the lecture notes easily and important points 
will also be found out very easily.This can be useful by the people of different languages as it has a special feature of 
Language translation.
